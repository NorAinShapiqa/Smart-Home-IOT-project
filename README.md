# Smart Home IoT Project

## Description
This repository contains the code for a Smart Home project that aims to automate various tasks within a home environment. I've made the following contributions to this project:

- Implemented ESP-01s to the Smart Home for internet connectivity.
- Integrated the project with the Blynk IoT platform for remote control and monitoring.
- Adding LEDs on every room of the Smart Home

## Original Project Source
This project is a continuation of the Smart Home IoT project initiated by the original creator. The original repository can be found at [Link to the Original Repository](https://github.com/NorAinShapiqa/Smart-Home-IOT-project).

## Required Libraries

- [RFID Library](https://miliohm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/RFID.zip)
- [RFID-master Library](https://miliohm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/rfid-master.zip)
- [DHTlib Library](https://github.com/RobTillaart/Arduino/tree/master/libraries/DHTlib)

## Installation

1. Download this repository.
2. Install the required libraries listed above by following the provided links.
3. Open the Arduino IDE and load the `SMART HOME_IOT PROJECT.ino` sketch from the repository.
4. Customize the code to fit your specific Smart Home setup, such as pins for sensors, Wi-Fi credentials, and Blynk authentication token.

## Usage

1. Upload the code to the Arduino Mega microcontroller.
2. Set up BLYNK by adding required data streams, UI, and more to control the Smart Home.
3. Use the Blynk app to remotely control and monitor the Smart Home devices and LEDs.
